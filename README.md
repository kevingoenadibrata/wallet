# Mini Wallet Project
## Installing
1. Make sure you have docker and npm installed to your machine
2. Run  `./setup.sh` on the main directory to setup docker and npm
3. Docker is currently running on the background

## Running
1. Run `npm start` to run the local server
2. Use either postman or any API Client  and hit `localhost:3000`

## Stopping Docker
1. Run `docker compose down` to stop the current docker
2. Run `docker compose down -v` or simply `./setup -c` to stop the docker and remove volume and data

## What if docker doesnâ€™t work on my machine
The Mini Wallet can also run on local memory, these are steps to configure the app to run on local memory instead of a database

1. find `.env` file in the main directory
2. modify `USE_LOCAL_DB=0` to `USE_LOCAL_DB=1`
3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm start`
5. The wallet app should be running

Note: when using local memory, data does not persist if you kill the server and rerun it again.

##  FAQ
1. What if when I hit the API it says connection refused?
	* Try waiting for a couple of seconds and run again, probably the docker is still setting up. 
2. How do I setup the authentication?
	* After hitting `/api/v1/init` make sure to plug in token to `Authentication: Bearer <token>`
3. What type of request body is accepted in this server?
	* `multipart/form-data` works best on this implementation
4. Somehow the database got corrupted, how do I reset?
	* To clean and redo the installation process, run `./setup.sh -c` and then`./setup.sh`
